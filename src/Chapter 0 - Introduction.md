#Quick-D6 Role Playing Game
###Two Dice and a Game Master: battle and loots in 15 minutes of setup.

This game is a great introduction for new pen and paper players. All you need is a prepared game master, a couple six-sided dice, and of course some pen and paper and you're ready to go!

###Equipment
1. Pen & Paper for each player
2. At least two six-sided dice, but more is better
3. A Game Master with a plan :)

###Character Creation
We recommend that the GMs should explain the available actions in combat, as well as how conflicts are resolved, before starting to create the player's characters.  
1. Each player should mark the following statistics on their character sheet:
- Health Points: 10; Power Points: 10
- Melee Skill: 5, Ranged Skill 5, Armor: 0
2. Each player should choose two starting Talents from the Chapter 2.
3. Each player should choose a Weapon, an Armor, and either another Weapon, one Accessory or two Consumables. These are all listed on Chapter 3.
4. Finally, each player should choose a name and a race (default: Human). These have no effects in-game.
