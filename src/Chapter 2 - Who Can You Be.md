### Who Can You Be? The Player's Starting Talents

In Qd6, the player's characters (PCs) does not level up- instead they gain talents. During character creation, each player chooses two different talents from the list below to start with, and as they progress through the game, they gain more talents.

> **GM's Note**   
> The talents below are detailed for gamemaster's understanding. If you have new players during character creation, explain the gist of each talent without going into details, unless asked otherwise.
>
> Defensive Talents: Defender, who can cancel melee attacks, and Controller, who can cancel ranged attacks.  
> Offensive Talents: Striker, who can take a penalty to hit for more damage, and Opportunist, who can hit opponents easier regardless of their skill.  
> Supportive Talents: Healer, who can replenish an allies' health if they are within reach, and Leader, who can let their allies reposition easier.
