This is the transcript of one of the playtest sessions while designing the game. Two of the players (B and C) are not gamers and have not played any pen and paper games at all, while A is a PC/console gamer, but also have not played any pen and paper games. D have played Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition several years prior, but is no longer playing any games.

GM: Hello! I am Erik, and I will be your Game Master this evening. We will be playing Qd6 today, on a Scenario called "Goblin King's Warband". You should all have pencils, paper, and a couple of six-sided dice with you?

A, B, C & D: Yes.

GM: Let's begin then! First, you need to know what you can do in combat. When it's your turn, you can Attack, Reposition yourself, Defend your allies, or Overwatch.

A: Overwatch?

GM: When you Overwatch, you immediately pass your turn, but if an opponent within your weapon's range moves, you get to Attack them. And if you hit, they can't move!

B: Can our opponents do this too?

GM: Yes

C: How do we know where everyone are?

GM: At the beginning of the encounter, I will describe the scene and where everyone are. After that, you can just ask me. Don't worry I will warn you when something's off. Any other questions?

A, B, C & D: None yet.

GM: Ok then! When you Attack, Reposition, Defend or Overwatch, then your turn is over! We call those Battle Actions. We also have Free Actions, but I will discuss those later in game.

GM: Now, you won't hit every monster, and every monster won't hit you. In order to resolve this conflict fairly, Qd6 uses two six-sided dice, or a "2d6". When you roll to resolve, you need at least 7 or higher to succeed.

A: \**Rolls an eight*\*  Like that?

GM: Yes! (Everyone rolls in the background) Now sometimes there will be bonuses that add to the result of your roll, such as when you're a better fighter than your opponent. Of course sometimes, there will be penalties also.

GM: Ok, that's everything you need to know regarding combat! It's time to create your characters. First you need to pick two talents!

A: Talents?

GM: Aside from the Battle Actions, your Talents give you additional Free Actions in combat. I will tell you the six talents, and you can ask me any questions about them afterwards, ok?

A, B, C & D: Ok.

GM: Alright then, the first two are Defensive in nature, and they basically do the same thing: when one of your allies are attacked, they can make that attack deal no damage. The difference are: The Defender Talent works on attacks within your reach via a melee attack \**makes a sword swinging motion*\*, while the Controller Talent works on attacks within your sight via a ranged attack \**makes a bow drawing motion*\*. Of course, covering fire is harder than blocking a sword.

GM: The next two are Offensive in nature: The Striker Talent can take a penalty to hit in order to deal more damage, while the Opportunist Talent can make a skilled blow bonus to hit even when the opponent is the more skilled fighter.

A: We will choose two talents, correct?

GM: Yes. The last two are Supportive in nature. The Healer Talent will let you heal yourself or an ally within reach by 2 Hp-

A: Hp?

GM: Health Points. You start with ten, and die when it hits zero. As I was saying, the Healer Talent can restore Health. On the other hand, the Leader Talent let's everyone near him or her Reposition as a Free Action. This is a passive talent, which means it's always active.

B: Wait. You mean, if I'm the Leader, I can reposition for free?

GM: No, your allies can. If A, C or D is within your reach, then they can Reposition, and still Attack, Overwatch or Defend.

GM: So, as you choose your Talents, I will suggest sets of equipment for the combination, and if you accept the talents and equipments, write them down on your paper. A, have you chosen?

A: Yes, I think. I think the Striker and Opportunist is good combination.

GM: All out offense?

A: Yeah!

GM: Twin short swords and some chainmail would help you land blows, while a greataxe, chainmail and two Potions of Anima would probably deal more damage.

A: More damage please. I'll write those down now.

GM: How about you, B?

B: A healer, definitely. I'm just not sure if I should pick Defender or Controller.

GM: The Defender heals besides the frontliners like A, while the Controller stays at the back throwing ranged heals.

B: I'll get back to you, I want to know what C & D would choose.

GM: Ok then, C?

C: I think Leader and Defender. A can push off from me and attack immediately, then I'd go near him and defend him.

A: Yeah, that's right! Good thinking.

GM: That's a good combination. I think a Longsword, a Shield and a Platemail would work with that tactic.

C: Those are fine.

GM: Ok then, how about you, D?

D: I want to be an Archer.

GM: Alright then, the Controller Talent would be helpful defensively, but do you want to deal more damage with the Striker Talent or hit easier with the Opportunist Talent?

D: I think a ranged striker is probably a magician. Controller/Opportunist is more accurate for my role.

GM: Ok then. You'd probably want a Longbow with twelve arrows, some Chainmail and two Potions of Anima. 

D: Can I have a Longsword, in case I run out of arrows?

GM: You'd lose both your potions.

D: That's ok.

GM: Very well then, write those down. B, do you want to join A & C at the front or stay with D at the back?

B: I think B can defend A just fine, so I'll stay back with D. I'm going with Healer and Controller.

GM: Ok then, a Curing Staff is probably the best weapon for you. Everyday Clothes won't limit your spells too much, while two Potions of Psyche would help in case you run out.

B: Ok.

GM: Alright, now that you all have talents and equipment, write the following to your character sheets.. Health Points: 10, Power Points: 10, Melee Skill: 5 and Ranged Skill: 5.

D: All of us have the same stats?

GM: Yes, but different talents and equipment. Speaking of, if you have a Plate or Chain Armor write Armor: 1, if not, write Armor: 0.

B: What's the different armors for?

GM: We will explore each of your equipment while in combat. But right now, you only need to name your characters and we can begin the adventure!
