## Chapter 3
### What Are You Wearing? The Player's Starting Equipment

Each player may wear one armor, two one-handed weapon or one two-handed weapon, and two accessories. In addition, they have ready access to up to two ammunition containers during combat.

All of the starting equipment can be procured from the Adventurer's Guild for free, within reason. These starting equipment, however, cannot be sold. Unless the players obtain a magical means to store multiple items, each item needs to be stored in their person, within reason. Each player can safely store up to 100 Gold Pieces in a handy satchel, although they start with no gold at all.

The list of tags and their effects are right after the lists of equipment.
