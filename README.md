# Quick-d6 Roleplaying Game
## A Quick Setup, Minimal Requirement and Fast Resolving Pen and Paper RPG

This pen and paper RPG is designed to be played by players who have little to no pen and paper experience. The player's Character Creation can be done in about 15 minutes, and conflict resolution are always just a roll of two six-sided dice against seven or higher.

Warning! If you are a Game Master, then prior pen and paper experience is required. The Qd6 system puts the burden of preparation and planning to the Game Master, besides the usual world building and combat scenarios.
