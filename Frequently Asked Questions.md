### A. Regarding Character Creation

A.1. **Can I choose the same talents, such as double Defender or double Striker?**

Short Answer: No.

Players have to choose two different talents when creating a new character. Even during character progression, they have to choose a talent that they do not have when spending experience points to buy a new talent.

### B. Regarding Equipment

B.1. **Do Ranged Attacks with the `Pyromancer's Wand` Ignore Armor?**

Short Answer: No.

Long Answer: The `Pyromancer's Wand` has the following tags: (Chapter 3)

|Item              |Damage| Tags                                                        | 
|------------------|:----:|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Pyromancer's Wand |1     |Weapon; Ranged; One-hand; 1FP/Attack; Fire 1 (Element: Fire) |

The Fire 1 tag has the following description: (Chapter 3, with the N replaced with 1)

| Tag                | Limitations    | Description                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Fire 1**          | Ranged Weapons | (2 Fp/Use) Make a Ranged Attack: If successful deal 1 damage to up to 3 targets in one group of your choice, ignoring armor; Attack gains Element: Fire |

As you can see, you have to **Use the Item** during combat (a free action) in order for the attack to gain the tag Element: Fire and ignore armor. The `Pyromancer's Wand`, and all other equipment that does not specifically have a passive tag that gives the weapon an element, deals normal, non-elemental damage when used in a Melee or Ranged Attack.
