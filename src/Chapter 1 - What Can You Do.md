###What Can You Do? Actions in Combat
There are two kinds of actions in Qd6: Battle Actions, which end your turn immediately afterwards, and Free Actions, which you can doesn't end your turn. Also, some actions may have requirements before you get the effect.

### Resolving Conflict
Sometimes, a conflict occurs between the players's characters and the characters that the GM controls (Monsters, etc.). The most common would be if an attack hit or not- since it won't be fair for the players if the monsters always hit, and vice versa. In order to resolve such conflicts, the Qd6 system uses the procedure below:

1. Roll two sixed-sided dice, or a '2d6'. Add bonuses and subtract penalties to the result. Note that modifiers with the same name **does not stack**; always use the highest value for bonuses and lowest value for penalties.
2. If the total is 7+, you succeed.
3. A Natural 2 always fails, and a Natural 12 always succeeds, regardless of bonuses or penalties.
